          <p>I am taking this class with <a href="https://epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> because I was curious about how programming works. Although I wouldn't mind a career change, I don't see myself pursuing this field seriously. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine for 3 years and lived in New York for 4 before moving to Chicago. Outside of this class I work as a translator from Ukrainian to English, mostly doing literature and, weirdly, art history. Before COVID-19 struck, I was working in pastry at <a href="https://floriole.com">Floriole</a>, a French bakery here in the city. If I lived in Portland, I would like to get a job at <a href="https://kensartisan.com">Ken's!</a></p>

            <p>This page tells you why you might wish you had voted for Shundar Lin for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation Board on election day in Cook County, IL.</p>

            <p>This is a boring lecture <em>in Latin</em> about cheese crackers. It was useful for ____.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/blog">my blog</a></li>
            <p>If I remember correctly, this blog doesn't talk about much. I think it was to practice using divs and spans.</p>

            <p>The most important thing about this blog was ____.</p>

            <p>This project was a bit tricky. My partner and I were working on using floats, divs, and spans, but we ran into a problem where our boxes were overlapping and the floats kept getting screwed up. Ben helped us fix it by showing us the trick of outlining all elements in red so we could see what was going on. In the end we used some flex wraps.</p>

            <p>My partner and I made this site to increase tourism to Macedonia, a country I've never visited.</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/resume">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a></li>
            <p>This was just my first attemp (not quite complete) at putting my r&eacute;sum&eacute; online. The two things I learned how to do for this project were use html code to include an n-dash (&ndash;) and use an inline class to make the dates float to the right.</p>
