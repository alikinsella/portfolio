          <p>I am taking this class with <a href="https://epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> because I was curious about how programming works. Although I wouldn't mind a career change, I don't see myself pursuing this field seriously. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine for 3 years and lived in New York for 4 before moving to Chicago. Outside of this class I work as a translator from Ukrainian to English, mostly doing literature and, weirdly, art history. Before COVID-19 struck, I was working in pastry at <a href="https://floriole.com">Floriole</a>, a French bakery here in the city. If I lived in Portland, I would like to get a job at <a href="https://kensartisan.com">Ken's!</a></p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/quarantine-blues">quarantine blues</a></li>
            <p>This page was practice working with Markdown.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/my-first-webpage">my first webpage</a></li>
            <p>This was the first webpage I made using html more or less on my own.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/shundar-lin">Shundar Lin for Metropolitan Water Reclamation Board</a></li>
            <p>This html page tells you why you <em>might wish</em> you had voted for Shundar Lin for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation Board on election day in Cook County, IL. If I remember correctly, it was for practicing making lists and using inline elements.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/boring-lecture">a boring lecture</a></li>
            <p>This is a boring lecture <em>in Latin</em> about cheese crackers. It was useful for practicing adding links and photos, and later for learning about divs and spans. It was also the first time we used lorem ipsum. The page uses html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/blog">my blog</a></li>
            <p>If I remember correctly, this blog doesn't talk about much. I think it was to practice using divs and spans. The page uses html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/cupcake-shop">Cupcakes from Hell</a></li>
            <p>Besides the delicious cupcakes, the most important thing about this project was learning how to use CSS to apply different styles to our html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/resume">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a></li>
            <p>This was just my first attemp (not quite complete) at putting my r&eacute;sum&eacute; online. The two things I learned how to do for this project were use html code to include an n-dash (&ndash;) and use an inline class to make the dates float to the right. The page uses html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/animal-shelter">animal shelter</a></li>
            <p>This project was a bit tricky. My partner and I were working on using floats, divs, and spans, but we ran into a problem where our boxes were overlapping and the floats kept getting screwed up. Ben helped us fix it by showing us the trick of outlining all elements in red so we could see what was going on. In the end we used some flex wraps. We also added some media queries to the end. The page uses html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/week-in-review">week in review</a></li>
            <p>This was a really big project for me and my partner. First it taught us how to use Bootstrap styles. After we stylized it, we were able to add column and row classes to make things fall into line. The page uses html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/vacation-site">vacation site</a></li>
            <p>My partner and I made this site to increase tourism to Macedonia, a country I've never visited. This was where we practiced using bootstrap on our own, especially helper classes. The page uses html.</p>
