    <h1>Ali's programming portfolio</h1>
    <h3>projects I've started at Epicodus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/cookie-recipe">cookie recipe</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/my-first-webpage">my first webpage</a></li>
      <p>This was the first webpage I made using html more or less on my own.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/shundar-lin">Shundar Lin for Metropolitan Water Reclamation Board</a></li>
      <p>This page tells you why you might wish you had voted for Shundar Lin for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation Board on election day in Cook County, IL.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/boring-lecture">a boring lecture</a></li>
      <p>This is a boring lecture <em>in Latin</em> about cheese crackers. It was useful for ____.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/blog">my blog</a></li>
      <p>If I remember correctly, this blog doesn't talk about much. I think it was to practice using divs and spans.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/cupcake-shop">Cupcakes from Hell</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella">animal shelter</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/vacation-site">vacation site</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/quarantine-blues">quarantine blues</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alikinsella/resume">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a></li>
      <p>This was just my first attemp (not quite complete) at putting my r&eacute;sum&eacute; online. The two things I learned how to do for this project were use html code to include an n-dash (&ndash;) and use an inline class to make the dates float to the right.</p>
